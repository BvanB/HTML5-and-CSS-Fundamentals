# HTML5-and-CSS-Fundamentals
edX HTML5 and CSS Fundamentals main project
This is the primary webpage project for edX's HTML 5 and CSS Fundamentals course. I will be updating it as I complete the various assignments. If you are taking this course, please be aware that the final product will likely be different than the one you will be creating for the course. I use this as a personal reference for when I'm creating my own webpages/projects. 

If you would like to learn more about the course, or take it yourself, go to https://www.edx.org/course/html5-css-fundamentals-w3cx-html5-0x-0. You will need to sign up for an edX account, which is free. The course can be audited for no cost, and a verified certificate can be added. This is part of the W3C Front-End Web Developer program.

Getting Started:
You will need a text editor capable of editing HTML and CSS files - I use Visual Studio Code but Atom or Sublime Text will work fine. You will also need a web browser (but I'm guessing you have one of those!)
